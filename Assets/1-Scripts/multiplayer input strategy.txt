Player menu strategy:

- USE MULTIPLAYER EVENT SYSTEM
- Players join in the menu and get placed under a PlayerInputManager object
  - PlayerInputManager will be a singleton placed into DoNotDestroyOnLoad to maintain input between scene changes.
- Set PlayerInput#uiInputModule to the InputSystemUIInputModule that is a part of each player's menu canvas
